// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Testing & Integration
// Implementation
// Maintain



//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
